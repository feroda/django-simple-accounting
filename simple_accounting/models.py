    Usage
    =====
    Say that you have a model ``Foo`` representing an economic subject in a given application domain: 
    in order to mark it as *subjective*, just use the following syntax:
    
        from simple_accounting.models import economic_subject 
         
         @economic_subject
         class Foo(models.Model):
             # model definition 
    
    Then, when you create an instance of model ``Foo``:
    
        foo = Foo()
        foo.save()
    
    a ``Subject`` instance pointing to ``foo`` is automatically created, and you can retrieve it 
    at any time by simply accessing the ``subject`` attribute of ``foo``:
    
        subj = foo.subject
    
    If ``foo`` is deleted at a later time, then ``subj`` is automatically deleted, too.
    
    Finally, if some accounting-related setup tasks should be performed at instance-creation time,
    you can place the relevant logic within a ``.setup_accounting()`` (instance) method,
    that will be automagically called when the model is instantiated.

    multiple flows of money may be needed to describe it. 
    
    So, a general transaction can be thought of as a set of money flows,

    instead, describe flows of money involving accounts belonging to different systems.
    
    By definition, the shared account - that from which all the splits composing a transaction
    start - must be a stock-like account (since flux-like accounts can't act as starting or ending points
    due to their own nature - they are waypoints).

    """
    A transaction between accounts.
    
    From an abstract point of view, a transaction is just a set of flows of money
    occurring between two or more accounts belonging to one or more accounting system(s).
    
    As a data structure, a transaction can be modeled by a 2-tuple: 
    
    ``(source, splits)``
    
    where:
    * ``source`` is a ``CashFlow`` instance describing the source account 
      and the amount of money flowing from/to it
    * ``splits`` is a tuple of ``Split`` instances describing the
      partial flows (a.k.a. *splits*) composing the transaction, and their
      paths through the accounting systems involved in the transaction.   
    
    So, a transaction can be defined as a collection of splits 
    sharing the same source account.
    
    A transaction is said to be:
    - *internal* iff the source and target accounts belong to the same accounting system 
    - *split* iff it's composed of multiple splits
    - *simple* iff it's both internal and non-split 
      
    
    Some facts deriving from these definitions:
    - internal transactions don't modify the total amount of money contained 
      within the (single) accounting system they operate on
    - on the other hand, non-internal transactions transfer money from/to an accounting system
      to/from one or more other accounting system(s)
    - the algebraic sum of cash-flows appearing in a transaction (one for each account involved)
      is zero: this descends from what we could call *law of conservation of money*
    
    Furthermore, a transaction is characterized by some metadata:
    * the date when it happened
    * a reason for the transfer
    * who autorized the transaction
    * the type of the transaction

    In turn, entries in a ledger are generated by transactions between different accounts

    * a ledger entry is generated for each account "touched" by the transaction

    minimum of two (for internal, non-split transactions) to maximum of `3n + 1` (for n-split
    transactions with all-distinct entry/exit points).

    * for stock-like ones, an entry registers a *change* in the *amount* of money contained 
      within the account

    """
    A descriptor providing an accounting API for models.
    
    Since accounting makes sense only for subjective models, this descriptor works 
    only in conjunction with them. 
    
    Usage
    =====
    Say that you have a model ``Foo`` representing an economic subject in a given application domain: 
    in order to enable the accounting API for it, just use the following syntax:
    
        from simple_accounting.models import economic_subject, AccountingDescriptor 
         
         @economic_subject
         class Foo(models.Model):
         
             # model definition
             accounting =  AccountingDescriptor()
    
    Then, when you create an instance of model ``Foo``:
    
        foo = Foo()
        foo.save()
    
    you can access the accounting API via the ``accounting`` instance's attribute:
    
        foo.accounting
        
    For example, the accounting system owned by that (subjective) model instance 
    can be retrieved as follows:
        
        foo.accounting.system
    
    Note that you can use a different name than ``accounting`` as the entry point to
    the accounting API (as long as it doesn't clash with an existing attribute of the
    model class, of course).
    
    If needed, you can also customize the proxy class implementing the accounting API: 
    just pass it as an argument when instantiating the descriptor:
        
        from simple_accounting.models import economic_subject, AccountingDescriptor
        from simple_accounting.models import AccountingProxy
        
        class MyProxyClass(AccountingProxy)
            # override/customize methods as needed
    
         @economic_subject
         class Foo(models.Model):
             # model definition
             accounting =  AccountingDescriptor(MyProxyClass)
             
    This may be useful if you want to add domain-specific behaviour to the base accounting API.
